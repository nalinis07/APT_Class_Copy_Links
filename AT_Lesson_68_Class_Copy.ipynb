        "As you add more and more independent variables, the $R^2$ squared values increases even if the independent variable has no contribution in predicting the values of the target variable. Hence, the adjusted $R^2$ value penalises the unnecessary inclusion of more independent variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "So, if adding more independent (or feature) variables leads to an increase in the adjusted $R^2$ value, then it is a good sign. However, if adding more independent (or feature) variables leads to a decrease in the adjusted $R^2$ value, it is a bad sign.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this case, the $R^2_{\\text{adj}}$ is quite high but the p-values for many of the columns is greater than 0.05 which is not a good sign. It means, these variables are insignificant in predicting the price of a car. Also, if we calculate variance inflation factor values for these columns, they would be very very high than 10.\n",
